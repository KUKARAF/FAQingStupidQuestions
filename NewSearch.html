<li>Casumo guarantee to review all withdrawals within 23 hours (usually we have your withdrawal processed much faster). When the people in our finance department have approved the withdrawal it takes up to three business days before the funds are available in your account for bank transfers (Sweden and Finland have instant bank transfers). The other withdrawal methods are available instant after approval.</li>
<li>When you request a withdrawal the amount gets reserved and will not be available in your Casumo balance. The chart below shows how long it takes before the funds are available on your bank account/e-wallet after approval.</li>

<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">Make sure all the information is filled out correctly. Are all the digits in the account number correct? Are you currently on the withdrawal or deposit page? Are you using one of our accepted cards (currently we do not accept Maestro)? If all the information is correct – reload the page or try a different browser (we recommend Google Chrome). The most common reason for failed deposits can be traced to your bank. Perhaps your Verified by VISA or MasterCard secure code failed? Your card might be affected by limitations or blocks regarding online and/or international payments? Did you check that your card was sufficiently funded? Do you have more than 5 credit cards activated at the same time? Please contact the card department of your bank for more information, and get back to us if the problem persists.</li>

<ul>
<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">Before you can withdraw your bonus money they need to be wagered. All bonuses must be wagered 30 times (deposit + bonus) and free spins winnings 30 times. You can make a withdrawal before you have fulfilled the wagering requirement, but then you will lose your bonus money.</li>

<ul>
<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">If you have bonus money in your account, they will play proportionately to your real money. If you have €10 in bonus cash and €10 in real money and bet €2, €1 will be bonus money and €1 real money. Winnings are distributed proportionately in the same way. If you get several bonuses at the same time the bonus money and the wagering requirements are bundled.</li>

<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">Casumo is more than just a casino. Here you receive valuables and trophies by collecting points that take you to new levels and planets.

<ul>
<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">When you create an account at Casumo a cute little casumo guy with a rope around its waist is born. The rope symbolizes the beginners’ level – the level that all newly hatched casumos begin their adventure at. At each new level you have the chance to win valuables, such as free cash and free spins. Your chances to win better valuables increases with each new level and if you continue to play a whole new planet with new levels will open up eventually.</li>

<ul>
<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">Sometimes you get some kind of reward when you level up, but not always. The reward system depends on many factors. All the points you collect are saved and transferred to the next level, and if you did not get a reward this time, the chance that you’re getting one next time is bigger.</li>

<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">Casumo has a European gaming license issued by the Gaming Authority in Malta, where we also have our headquarters and support.

<ul>
<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">All online gambling operators such as Casumo follow anti money laundering regulations from several governing bodies. In addition, we are also committed to host a secure and safe gambling environment where player integrity and protection of your funds is always a priority. Security checks, commonly known as KYC (Know Your Customer) are performed on a regular basis. They are most common whilst requesting a withdrawal, however, they can also be in relation to deposits or as random sample checks. You only need to verify your account once, however, there is a chance we ask for additional documentation in the future based on your account history.</li>

   <a class="question" href="/en/faq/#how-do-i-verify-my-account"><strong data-bind="html: question">How do I verify my account?</strong></a><p></p>
<ul>
<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">It couldn’t be easier. Just upload files of the requested documents and let us do the rest. The account verification tab will become visible in your Casumo account when we have sent you a verification request. Once your documents have been approved, they are safely archived on secure servers. The type of documents we ask for depends on your deposit and withdraw method and if you reach certain thresholds. We’ll let you know when something is needed, and the verification is usually done within a couple of hours. Make sure your uploads are of good quality so that we can read the relevant details and approve them. We accept most file formats, but the size limit is 8MB. Here’s a short summary of the most common documents needed and what to keep in mind whilst prepping them.<strong>Verify identity</strong><br>
   A copy of your passport, national identity card or driving license to verify your age and identity. In addition we accept several national types of alternative identity cards for certain countries. During the verification process you will see which kind of identity document we accept for your country. Other things to keep in mind:<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The expiration date must be valid.</li>
<li>Must be a personal identification document.</li>
<li>All four corners of the document must be visible.</li>
<li>Copy of both front and back is required.</li>
<li>Must be a government issued or approved photo document.</li>
<li>Don’t cover or alter any details.</li>
</ul>
<p>   <strong>Verify address</strong><br>
   An invoice or an electronic bill with your adress on it normally does the trick. We also accept most types of government documents or bank statements as proof of address. The document should be in your name, match the address on your Casumo account and be issued within the last six months. Other things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole invoice must be visible.</li>
<li>Screenshots of bank statements/electronic bills must include the URL (website address).</li>
<li>Don’t cover or alter any details.</li>
</ul>
<p>   <strong>Verify Deposit (bank transfer)</strong><br>
   A bank statement showing at least one deposit to your Casumo account, account holder’s name and bank details (IBAN and SWIFT if possible) is enough. Both paper copies and electronic versions of your bank statement works, as long as it shows the information we need. All electronic bank statements must include the URL (website address) in the screenshot. The above also applies in those cases where we only need to verify that you are the account holder of the bank account. In those cases the statement also needs to show any deposits made to your Casumo account.</p>
<p>   <strong>Verify deposit (VISA &amp; MasterCard)</strong><br>
   This is usually asked for when we cannot process withdrawals directly back to your card for some reason. It can be due to restrictions in your country or the card type simply doesn’t support it. A bank statement showing at least one deposit to your Casumo account with the card in question, account holder’s name and bank details (IBAN and SWIFT if possible) will ensure that we have the link between your card and bank account. This is important as the origin and the destination of the funds should be the same if possible. Other things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screenshots of bank statements must include the URL (website address).</li>
<li>If visible on the bank statement, cover the card number n this format: 1234 56xx xxxx 1234.</li>
<li>You can cover transactions that doesn’t concern Casumo.</li>
</ul>
<p>   <strong>Verify E-wallet</strong><br>
   A screenshot of your account overview showing your personal details and account details is enough. We might also request a screenshot of the transactions overview that shows at least one of your deposits to Casumo. The URL (website address) should be visible in the screenshot.</p></li>

<ul>
<li class="answer h4 markdown" data-bind="markdown: answer">If you want to limit your play we offer you several different options to choose from. You can set up limits for spending, deposits, losses and wagering and they are available to you on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. When setting your limit it will start taking into account your activity from the time you set it. For example, should you decide to set a weekly limit on Wednesday, it will reset midnight to Monday and then continue to run from Monday to Sunday from there on.You also have the option to suspend access to your account. This can be done either via a break for up to 6 months, or a self-exclusion for a minimum period of 6 months if you feel you have been playing too much or are concerned that your gambling habits might be becoming a problem.Read more about the different limitations available and how they work by visiting our Play Okay page <a href="/en-gb/play-okay/">here</a>.</li>
